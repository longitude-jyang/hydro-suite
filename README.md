# hydro-suite
A suite of codes for hydrodynamic analysis of offshore slender structures. This suite consists of eight nested codes of different fidelities (see the possible combination of arrow routes in the chart below). For example, the simplest one is for regular harmonic wave --> rigid body stcuture --> linear frequency response analysis; while the most complicated one is random wave --> flexible structure --> nonlinear time domain analysis. 

- Start with [Introduction](/docs/ASuiteOfCodeForDynamicModellingOfSlenderOffshoreStructures.pdf) to get the big picture of what is inside the code 

- For the code, starts with [callcode](/Codes/callcode.m)
